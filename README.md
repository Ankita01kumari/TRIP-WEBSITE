# TRIP-WEBSITE

THIS IS MY FIRST PHP WEBSITE THAT I MADE USING BASIC KNOWLDEGE OF PHP,HTML,CSS AND JAVA SCRIPT.
IT'S JUST A SIMPLE WEBSITE THAT TAKES INTO CONSIDERATION THE STUDENTS WHO WANT TO JOIN FOR THE US TRIP FROM OUR UNIVERSITY.
I ALSO USED MYSQL FOR STORING THE DATA THAT HAS BEEN FILLED IN THIS US TRIP FORM USING MYPHPADMIN.I JUST CREATED THE DATABASE AND THEN GAVE THE TITLE TO THE COULUMN AND DECIDED THE NUMBER OF COLUMNS THAT WOULD BE REQUIRED AND THEN JUST MENTIONED THE REQUIRED DATA TYPES ACCORDINGLY AND SAVED IT.
